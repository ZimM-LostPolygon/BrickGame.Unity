# BrickGame.Unity
A bare-bones Tetris-like brick game in C#/Unity made in C# from scratch in 5 hours during a livestream.

Based on https://tetris.fandom.com/wiki/SRS (Super Rotation System) and loosely follows the [Tetris Guideline](https://tetris.fandom.com/wiki/Tetris_Guideline).

The code isn't particularly neat or optimized, the goal was to implement the main game loop with correct behaviour matching official Tetris games.
